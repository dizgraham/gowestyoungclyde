### Day I: HOH --> Perrysburg -- Let's go to California! [7.2.21]

- A slow and somber start to the day.  After running some errands in Hastings, we drove by our (former) house one last time and headed out of town.  Graham DJ'd, Marin drove, Michael and Nicole got teary and we pulled out onto the Saw Mill.  After a few quiet moments, someone said "well that is very sad, but let's go to California!"  We rallied, pumped the music and were on our way.
- After weeks of growing agitation over the packing and commotion, Clyde could not have been happier that he was, in fact, getting to go in the car with the family.  That milestone behind him, he quickly found new things to worry about, like whether he should have his head on his seat or in front of it, whether he should stand, sit, or lay down and whether it was ok to sit after turning around once or he needed to do it two or three times first.  It took most of the day for him to start to relax, but he got there (thanks to a little help from Michael, the unlikeliest of sources).

- Graham, as our DJ and benevolent leader, is keeping a spotify playlist of the songs that we listen to. There's something for everyone to love...

  `Marin and I listened to some slightly-less old-person music, too.`

- Graham, head intellectual of the family, is also keeping us informed of some of the key legal considerations as we enter each new state:
  - New Jersey: the last state in the nation where it is illegal to pump your own gas
  - Pennsylvannia: one may not catch a fish with one's mouth
  - Ohio: for minor crimes, you can't be arrested on a Sunday or July 4th, unless, of course, you're on a river
- We spent the night in Perrysburg, OH.  
  - Our hotel was in a manufactured little village, which was eerily reminiscent of the Truman Show, but had a nice pizza place where we enjoyed a late meal (Graham chose the 5 meat pizza) before crashing.

  - Clyde's first night in a hotel.  We were relieved that he didn't feel the need to mark the room.  
- Other notes:
  - We played an intense session of the sign game, with steals, no cars and no "exit."  It ended when everyone but the driver fell asleep.  Nicole's in the lead, but we're hot on her heels. To be continued.

  - It was an active weather day across the region.  We went through 5 or 6 bands of intense rain, with bright blue skies for hours in between.

  - We've made the usual friends with cars that have shared the road for hours with us, sad to see them go when they exit and wondering if any of them has in front of them the miles that we will cover.
- Drivers: Marin (about 300 miles), Nicole (about 200) and Michael (the rest)

### Day II: Perrysburg -> Chicago --> Madison -- Go Badgers! [7.3.21]

- An early and quiet start to day 2.  The Home2 Suites breakfast of cinnamon rolls, bagels, waffles and lucky charms wasn't enough to get this crowd perked up.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124494454-798e8a80-dd7c-11eb-9775-50d08f886bf7.jpeg)

- Graham, in all of his everlasting greatness, has reattached the Spotify playlist here. Everyone listened individually for a couple hours, but the tunes started pumping again after our brief stop at Notre Dame.

  `Because it's the same playlist, you'd have to scroll down to see the new stuff. We started off today with "A Little Honey" by Nathaniel Rateliff.`
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1ZHCIsZQoCSuxnJTpvHY1e" width="600" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
- In a move reminiscent of the days of road atlases, Nicole studied our route and noticed that we would be passing right by South Bend and we couldn't pass up the chance to see the old stomping grounds of that great Notre Dame legend, Rudy Ruettiger.  Wow - what a beautiful campus!  
- From there, it was on to Chicago.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124494960-1c470900-dd7d-11eb-858c-baab9d5d54f6.jpeg)

- We had scheduled in a few hours so we could see a bit of the city and have lunch.  We wandered around downtown, mostly Grant and Millenium parks, and had an amazing lunch of deep dish and stuffed pizza at Chicago's Pizzeria (many thanks to Erik for the recommendation).  We also spent a little time wandering around the Lake View neighborhood, which was very cool.

- Fueled by some dark matter (a coffee shop, not a new fuel source, although maybe that's what powering those UFOs), we headed for the main event of the trip - Madison, WI!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124485251-0253f900-dd72-11eb-8682-a0bd12dfd755.jpeg)

  - 2 hours later, we pulled into Madison.  What a beautiful place!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124485378-1ac41380-dd72-11eb-9406-420935159f2a.jpeg)

  - We headed straight for Marin's dorm, Adams, which is SO COOL!  

  - Adams is in the Lakeside dorm complex - aptly named for its proximity to Lake Mendota, which is about as picturesque as it gets.  (For anyone who hasn't read Crossing to Safety by Wallace Stegner, we highly recommend it.  The lake features prominently in the beginning of the story.)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124486961-bf932080-dd73-11eb-9fc7-35738335bae6.jpeg)

  - The evening in Madison featured some choice time, with Graham hanging out in the hotel listening to music, Marin and Clyde going exploring and Nicole and Michael planting themselves on the hotel's rooftop bar.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124487177-0254f880-dd74-11eb-97b4-ce25fc60ee13.jpeg)

- An update on Clyde: he's now totally comfortable in the van, still mystified by elevators and has gone 2 for 2 in days not peeing in the hotel.  Good boy, Clyde.
- Graham's legal considerations:
  - Indiana: Fishing with a fire arm is legal, as is fishing with one's bare hands; not clear whether other means of fishing are permissible.
  - Illinois: It is against the law to sleep in a cheese shop, or ride a bike with no hands, no feet or otherwise in an acrobatic manner.
  - Wisconsin: If you sell home baked cookies, bring enough to feed yourself for 6 months, because that's how long you could end up in the slammer.
- Thanks to John for some great contributions to the playlist!  If anyone else has any suggestions, text them to DJ G-Dizzy (TM by Darren).
- Miles were evenly split between M&M

### Day III: July 4th in Madison [7.4.21]

- We spent the day in Madison, exploring the school and town.
- The campus is connected to the capitol building by State Street.  It's about a 20 minute walk from one end to the other, and it's great - it's full of shops, restaurants and bars, has a great energy at night and a nice feel during the day.  We had coffee near the school and breakfast near the capitol.
- The four of us then set out on bikes to get a more thorough look at the campus.  We saw a few of the buildings where Marin will have classes next semester, as well as Camp Randall, the football stadium, and the Memorial Union, which is the main student center but also a gathering place for the town (more on that later).

- It was a very hot day, so we headed back to the hotel after a while for downtime.  Marin and Michael had an intense card battle across multiple games, while Graham worked on some AV priorities and Nicole read up on Madison.
- Michael and Nicole then headed back to the Memorial Union to sit on the terrace, which is a huge and very cool space overlooking lake Mendota.  With a table in the shade, refreshments readily available and a beautiful lake to look at, it was easy to let time pass by for a while.  It's fun to think about all of the good times Marin will have here starting in just a couple of months.

- They followed that with another bike ride around campus (including the Kohl Center, home of our beloved Badger basketball), a check in with the kids and then a return to the terrace.
- All four of us enjoyed dinner, people watching and fireworks on the terrace into the evening.

### Day IV: Madison --> Chamberlain, SD -- Storm! [7.5.21]

- We loved our time in Madison and were not eager to leave, but we had a long day of driving ahead of us so we got on the road fairly early.
- Marin was behind the wheel again to start the day - such a luxury for her parents! - and powered through mile after mile.  We drove up the isthmus (Trivia: which other prominent US city sits on an isthmus?) and headed west, through the rest of Wisconsin, aross Minnesota almost with stopping and into South Dakota.  
- The landscape was beautiful, with cornfields and other crops covering rolling hills as far as the eye could see.  This is also an area that has invested heavily in electricity-generating windmills.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124623930-08b1a600-de42-11eb-95cc-9447ae230ae6.jpeg)
- There's not a whole lot to report from the first 8 hours of the drive, but then things got exciting.  We noticed a storm in the forecast for that evening in Chamberlain.  The sky was definitely dark ahead of us in the distance, but we didn't think much of it.  Marin casually wondered out loud how one stays safe in a tornado when riding in a car
  - rule #1: don't be in a car
  - rule #2: if you are in a car, don't try to outrun a tornado; put your head below the windows and pray 
  - (To put the grandparents' hearts at ease, there are no tornados in this story.) 
- As we drove on (Michael now behind the wheel), that dark sky started to take on a greenish hue and the car got quiet. Then a gust of wind moved the car half way into the other lane.    
  - We drove into what seemed like a green snow globe, with very high winds, but no rain.  After about 3-4 miles of being inside it, we pulled off at an exit. We needed gas anyway, but also wanted to see how the locals were reacting to the storm. They weren't huddling in bunkers, so we got back on the highway. The wind was so strong that we were only going 40-50 mph but the RPMs on the engine were where they had been when we were going 85 (speed limit is 80!). After a few more minutes the rain starting coming down hard as hell. The sky turned back to a normal gray and our worries about a tornado subsided a bit. After about 10-15 minutes we were through the worst of it. The temperature had dropped 30 degrees (from 97 to 67)! 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124624979-0439bd00-de43-11eb-9397-643ee4f7d2a3.jpeg)

- Chamberlain is a quite town, seemingly driven by the fishing on the Missouri and its tributaries.  
  - We ate dinner at a place in Chamberlain called Charly's, which is owned by a 92-year old woman who still cooks the food every day.  Delicious!  Graham wasn't into taking pictures, but we still had fun.  (Marin decided to take a night off from going out.)

  - We picked up dessert at Casey's general store (proprietor unknown, but good to see Chamberlain showing out with gender neutral names).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124625209-3b0fd300-de43-11eb-9338-17cf90adb11b.jpeg)

 Other notes:
  - We crossed two mighty rivers - first the Mississippi and then the Missouri

  - Glacial sea stacks in Minnesota were a surprise treat!

  - We are loving the songs suggestions!  The DJ duties have moved around a bit, so we don't have everything in one playlist just yet, but that is to-come.
  - Map of the drive is to come as well.

### Day V: Chamberlain --> Deadwood, SD -- Badlands and Blackhills [7.6.21]

- We left Chamberlain and headed for the Badlands.  On the way into the park, we pulled off and took a look at a preserved homesteader’s sod house from 1909, the signs for which boasted, among other things, rare white prairie dogs.  Once we walked past them, the prairie dogs (deemed vermin by Marin) popped out-our exclusive wildlife sighting thus far, sigh.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/125146141-4aa84980-e0d9-11eb-9487-5e1f19e53074.jpeg)

- A note about the Badlands: The Lakota and French fur trappers agreed the land was inhospitable and difficult to traverse so the name has stuck.  The striated landforms are clayey structures that look like drip castles (Marin.) Graham was inspired to climb up onto the top of one so that he was the highest point in the landscape. The reddish layers of the Badlands contain fossilized material from sea creatures when the land was under water.

- We drove the scenic loop of this exotic landscape and exited at Wall, SD where we secured a bumper sticker (free!) for Marin’s friend from Wall Drug.
- We had a fantastic lunch in Rapid City and were charmed by the old western buildings, numerous book and antique stores, and art alley.  We’ll take a college town anywhere.
- After lunch we drove to Mount Rushmore.  It was powerful and beautiful and we loved it.  An historian had proposed a different collection of subjects, but the sculptor, Gutzon Borglum chose the four presidents to represent the birth, growth, development and preservation of our country.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124856660-27aa5800-df68-11eb-9719-0cd3edaf1ed0.jpeg)

- We drove all around the Black Hills, doused in thick veering of ponderosa pines and saw the stone profile of Crazy Horse, an ambitious project still under construction.  
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124857339-6096fc80-df69-11eb-9799-16056ce856d0.jpeg)

- We ended our day in the town of Deadwood, SD.  Deadwood has been placed on the national register of historic places, which is not surprising when you see all of the preserved buildings from the late 19th century and early 20th century and read about its Wild West history.  We enjoyed a re-enactment of a shootout in the the street from the roof of the social club, overtop of saloon #10. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/124856975-b61ed980-df68-11eb-92bc-801b98cedae4.jpeg)

- The casino floor of our hotel was created through adaptive re-use of the Homestake Slime Plant which extracted gold from slime (a by-product of crushed ore that is suspended in water.) The gold came from the largest and deepest gold mine in North America in the town of Lead.  The casino is built on seven-foot thick concrete poured in 1935 with rafters overhead of Douglas fir from the Pacific Northwest, fitted into mortise and tenon joints.

### Day V: Deadwood, SD --> Bozeman, MT -- Little Bighorn and Lots of Driving [7.7.21]

- Deadwood has a on old gas station, called the Pump House, that’s been converted into a breakfast spot in the morning, a pizza place in the evening and a glass blowing studio at all hours. We liked it so much Michael and Nicole went twice before leaving Deadwood.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/125122849-33566580-e0b3-11eb-94f4-c47e5153cfb0.jpeg)

- The first time they went was after their morning run, the first stop on which was Mt. Moriah Cemetery, which is the final resting place of Wild Bill, Calamity Jane and lot of other people who died a long time ago.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70125813/125123053-6f89c600-e0b3-11eb-8636-c9c623c79db8.jpeg)

- Other sites on the run included a vintage motorcycle restoration stop and a liquor store whose name suggests its clientele is of the place.  

- We left Deadwood happy to have seen it but not feeling any strong desire to return.
- We drove through the Northern Cheyenne and Crow reservations and miles and miles of ranch lands.
