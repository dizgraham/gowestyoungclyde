## The Diz Family's California road trip

Stories, photos, and a mile count of our journey, day-by-day.

### Day I: HOH -> Perrysburg -- Let's go to California!

- A slow and somber start to the day.  After running some errands in Hastings, we drove by our (former) house one last time and headed out of town.  Graham DJ'd, Marin drove, Michael and Nicole got teary and we pulled out onto the Saw Mill.  After a few quiet moments, someone said "well that is very sad, but let's go to California!"  We rallied, pumped the music and were on our way.
- After weeks of growing agitation over the packing and commotion, Clyde could not have been happier that he was, in fact, getting to go in the car with the family.  That milestone behind him, he quickly found new things to worry about, like whether he should have his head on his seat or in front of it, whether he should stand, sit, or lay down and whether it was ok to sit after turning around once or he needed to do it two or three times first.  It took most of the day for him to start to relax, but he got there (thanks to a little help from Michael, the unlikeliest of sources).
- Graham is keeping a spotify playlist of the songs that we listen to.  We will put a link to it here if we can figure out how. There's something for everyone to love...
- Graham is also keeping us informed of some of the key legal considerations as we enter each new state:
  - New Jersey: the last state in the nation where it is illegal to pump your own gas
  - Pennsylvannia: one may not catch a fish with one's mouth
  - Ohio: for minor crimes, you can't be arrested on a Sunday or July 4th, unless you're on a river
- We spent the night in Perrysburg, OH.  
  - Our hotel was in a manufactured little village, which was eerily reminiscent of the Truman Show, but had a nice pizza place where we enjoyed a late meal (Graham chose the 5 meat pizza) before crashing.
  - Clyde's first night in a hotel.  We were relieved that he didn't feel the need to mark the room.  
- Other notes:
  - We played an intense session of the sign game, with steals, no cars and no "exit."  It ended when everyone but the driver fell asleep.  Nicole's in the lead, but we're hot on her heels. To be continued.
  - It was an active weather day across the region.  We went through 5 or 6 bands of intense rain, with bright blue skies for hours in between.
  - We've made the usual friends with cars that have shared the road for hours with us, sad to see them go when they exit and wondering if any of them has in front of them the miles that we will cover.
- Miles: 574; drivers: Marin (about 300), Nicole (about 200) and Michael (the rest)
