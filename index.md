Stories, photos, and a mile count of our journey, day-by-day.

### Day I: HOH -> Perrysburg -- Let's go to California!

- A slow and somber start to the day.  After running some errands in Hastings, we drove by our (former) house one last time and headed out of town.  Graham DJ'd, Marin drove, Michael and Nicole got teary and we pulled out onto the Saw Mill.  After a few quiet moments, someone said "well that is very sad, but let's go to California!"  We rallied, pumped the music and were on our way.
- Graham is keeping a spotify playlist of the songs that we listen to.  We will put a link to it here if we can figure out how. There's something for everyone to love...
